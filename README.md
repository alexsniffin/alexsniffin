### About

Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm currently a software engineer with an interest in building distributed systems. 

My preferred programming language is Go but I also have experience in Scala, C#, Python, JS and more.

I'm currently exploring how to utilize LLM's for building new projects around developer tooling and autonomous systems.
