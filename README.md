### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently a software engineer and work with Go across a distributed environment (mostly in Kubernetes)
- I occasionally publish articles to [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexsniffin) sharing my experiences
- Interested in contributing to new open-source projects and expanding my contributions back to the community
- Currently learning Rust ðŸ¦€!
